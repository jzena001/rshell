Once you have cloned the directory to your local machine, follow the directions below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. `cd` into `rshell` directory

2. Call `make`

3. `cd` into `bin`

4. Call `rshell` executable file

RShell will now open up instead of BASH and you can execute all commands included in usr/bin.

Program reviewed by the University of California, Riverside.
------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Overview of Command Shells: [HERE](http://linuxgazette.net/111/ramankutty.html)

This program is developed to write a simple command shell called "RShell."

- It will offer similarities such as the normal BASH Command shell.

- Can call all commands of BASH in usr/bin

- Can call on multiple commands using connectors "&&" "||" and ";" 

- Can check if the path exists and is a file or directory.

- Have special built in command "exit" to exit RSHELL and return to your local SHELL
